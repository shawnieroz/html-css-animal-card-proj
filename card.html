			<p class="description">A giraffeâ€™s height is helpful for keeping a look out for predators, 
				such as lions and hyenas. Their excellent eyesight allows 
				them to 
				spot hungry beasts from far away, too.
				Giraffes are very social animals and roam around in groups. 
				These groups, 
				called towers, typically have around 15 members 
				led by an adult male. 
				The other members are females and young males.</p>
